      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>While the environmental impact has become an important IT governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether its disclosure is valued by token holders of platforms based on blockchain IT infrastructure and how these platforms react to changing public awareness of their environmental impacts. We consider Elon Musk's 2021 announcement that Tesla would suspend accepting Bitcoin as payment because of Bitcoin mining's environmental impact as a shock that dramatically increases awareness of Bitcoin mining's environmental impacts. We find that, subsequent to the shock, infrastructure platforms which have larger environmental impacts than application platforms, are 
      more likely to disclose environmental impact information than application platforms and that their token market values grow at a slower 
      rate, consistent with the increased awareness spills over to other token-based platforms. Furthermore, whereas pre-shock environmental 
      impact disclosure by infrastructure platforms reduces token market value growth rates, post-shock disclosure has the opposite effect, 
      consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing, respectively.</p>

      <p>Traditional centralized models allow consumers to provide input, but are often limited by selection biases. Instead, blockchain-based decentralized models extend all consumer voice but face sustainability challenges including unsustained contributions and voting power concentration. Utilizing data from a blockchain-based K-pop platform, this study investigates whether fans continue contributing to the platform after initially participating in voting rounds. Findings indicate that voting power becomes less concentrated over time, likely because voters who have smaller voting power value the equity of decentralized voting and increase both tangible and intangible contributions. Conversely, voters who have larger voting power experience expectation disconfirmation; they begin with high expectations about influencing outcomes but if their preferences are disappointed, they decrease tangible contributions while maintaining intangible contributions. We use value cocreation and expectation disconfirmation theory to explain the phenomenon. This study contributes to blockchain and user innovation research and offers practical insights for platform designers aiming to create equitable, sustainable consumer-driven ecosystems.</p>

        Digital asset marketplaces, such as NFT marketplaces, merge primary and secondary markets, enabling resales. While resale royalties in such resale-centric settings are well studied, the impact of expanding primary supply is less understood. Cross-side network theory predicts that more supply should raise demand; however, a substitution effect may emerge. When primary supply competes with secondary listings, greater primary supply can reduce secondary resale opportunities and thereby dampen demand. We study this mechanism using Foundation's removal of invitation-only onboarding on May 19, 2022, with SuperRare as a comparison market. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that Foundation experiences a 1.9% average weekly decline in bids, 8.8% among active traders, consistent with the substitution effect. Traders with greater resale experience bid less, suggesting heightened uncertainty about resale profits. When prior resales are successful, traders are more willing to bid on riskier NFTs from new minters or those with potential copyright concerns. On the supply side, minters reduce listings by 7.5%, with larger declines among those who had invitation privileges. Our results inform supply controls of resale-focused marketplaces.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Public blockchains with smart contract functionality have revolutionized IT operations by enabling fully algorithmic processes and providing high transparency through realtime and detailed information disclosure. Yet, the impact of this IT operational model on user engagement remains largely unexplored. Leveraging the context of stablecoin platforms, particularly in light of the Terra-LUNA crisis, we construct a large-scale individual-level panel dataset from April 12 to June 1, 2022, and apply a cross-platform difference-in-differences approach. We find that, during crises, users can effectively distinguish between algorithmic and institutional IT operations, as well as their respective types of operational transparency. We also find that the presence of attackers switches user preferences for operational transparency. Higher levels of transparency, characterized by frequent and detailed information disclosures, may be perceived as catalysts for attacks in the post-crisis period, significantly impacting user engagement.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>This study investigates the public's perception of retail central bank digital currency (rCBDC) and identifies the factors influencing its adoption. Conducted in collaboration with a prominent bank in Hong Kong, this research involved a hands-on experience with a prototype payment system making using of an e-HKD, being an rCBDC which could be implemented in Hong Kong. Participants' opinions on rCBDCs were assessed through surveys conducted before and after their engagement with the e-HKD pilot. Initially, participants displayed a broadly positive attitude towards rCBDC, although no single factor emerged as a decisive influence on their adoption decision. However, the pilot experience statistically significantly altered perceptions, particularly regarding security, ease of payment, and promotional functions, thereby impacting their willingness to adopt rCBDC. This study underscores the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and suggests that these perceptions are subject to change through exposure to regulatory information campaigns, prototype experiences, and initial models.Consequently, the study recommends a cautious approach to interpreting the reliability of existing survey findings in this domain.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>We propose a Central Bank Digital Currency Evaluation and Verification (CEV) Framework for recommending and verifying technical solutions in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) system. We demonstrate two sub-frameworks: an evaluation sub-framework that provides consensus algorithm and operating architecture solutions and a verification sub-framework that validates the proposed solutions. Our framework offers a universal CBDC solution that is compatible with different national economic and regulatory regimes. The evaluation sub-framework generates customized solutions by splitting the consensus algorithms into several components and analyzing their impacts on CBDC systems. CBDC design involves a trade-off between system features - the consensus algorithm cannot achieve all system features simultaneously. However, we also improve the operating architectures to compensate for the weak system features. The verification sub-framework helps verify our proposed solution through empirical experiments and formal proof. Our framework offers CBDC designers the flexibility to iteratively tune the trade-off between CBDC system features for the desired solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a framework to recommend and verify CBDC technical solutions.</p>

      <p>FinTech and RegTech integration is essential for developing regulated digital currency (RDC) systems that are scalable and compliant. This paper proposes an unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based sharding method to address scalability challenges in RDCs. Results show UTXO-based sharding delivers linear throughput increase and consistently low latency by minimizing cross-shard transactions as the shard count grows. However, frequent user onboarding across shards under UTXO-based sharding models complicates know-your-customer (KYC) processes, highlighting regulatory inefficiencies. We demonstrate that zero-knowledge proofs seamlessly integrate with UTXO-based sharding to streamline customer onboarding and overcome regulatory burdens. Overall, this research pioneers FinTech-RegTech integration with practical implications for deploying high-performance, compliant RDC systems by synergistically combining UTXO-based sharding for scalability and zero-knowledge proofs for efficient regulation.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>While the environmental impact has become an important IT governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether its disclosure 
      is valued by token holders of platforms based on blockchain IT infrastructure and how these platforms react to changing public awareness 
      of their environmental impacts. We consider Elon Musk's 2021 announcement that Tesla would suspend accepting Bitcoin as payment because 
      of Bitcoin mining's environmental impact as a shock that dramatically increases awareness of Bitcoin mining's environmental impacts. 
      We find that, subsequent to the shock, infrastructure platforms which have larger environmental impacts than application platforms, are 
      more likely to disclose environmental impact information than application platforms and that their token market values grow at a slower 
      rate, consistent with the increased awareness spills over to other token-based platforms. Furthermore, whereas pre-shock environmental 
      impact disclosure by infrastructure platforms reduces token market value growth rates, post-shock disclosure has the opposite effect, 
      consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing, respectively.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Traditional centralized models allow consumers to provide input, but are often limited by selection biases. Instead, blockchain-based decentralized models extend all consumer voice but face sustainability challenges including unsustained contributions and voting power concentration. Utilizing data from a blockchain-based K-pop platform, this study investigates whether fans continue contributing to the platform after initially participating in voting rounds. Findings indicate that voting power becomes less concentrated over time, likely because voters who have smaller voting power value the equity of decentralized voting and increase both tangible and intangible contributions. Conversely, voters who have larger voting power experience expectation disconfirmation; they begin with high expectations about influencing outcomes but if their preferences are disappointed, they decrease tangible contributions while maintaining intangible contributions. We use value cocreation and expectation disconfirmation theory to explain the phenomenon. This study contributes to blockchain and user innovation research and offers practical insights for platform designers aiming to create equitable, sustainable consumer-driven ecosystems.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Public blockchains with smart contract functionality have revolutionized IT operations by enabling fully algorithmic processes and providing high transparency through realtime and detailed information disclosure. Yet, the impact of this IT operational model on user engagement remains largely unexplored. Leveraging the context of stablecoin platforms, particularly in light of the Terra-LUNA crisis, we construct a large-scale individual-level panel dataset from April 12 to June 1, 2022, and apply a cross-platform difference-in-differences approach. We find that, during crises, users can effectively distinguish between algorithmic and institutional IT operations, as well as their respective types of operational transparency. We also find that the presence of attackers switches user preferences for operational transparency. Higher levels of transparency, characterized by frequent and detailed information disclosures, may be perceived as catalysts for attacks in the post-crisis period, significantly impacting user engagement.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>This study investigates the public's perception of retail central bank digital currency (rCBDC) and identifies the factors influencing its adoption. Conducted in collaboration with a prominent bank in Hong Kong, this research involved a hands-on experience with a prototype payment system making using of an e-HKD, being an rCBDC which could be implemented in Hong Kong. Participants' opinions on rCBDCs were assessed through surveys conducted before and after their engagement with the e-HKD pilot. Initially, participants displayed a broadly positive attitude towards rCBDC, although no single factor emerged as a decisive influence on their adoption decision. However, the pilot experience statistically significantly altered perceptions, particularly regarding security, ease of payment, and promotional functions, thereby impacting their willingness to adopt rCBDC. This study underscores the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and suggests that these perceptions are subject to change through exposure to regulatory information campaigns, prototype experiences, and initial models.Consequently, the study recommends a cautious approach to interpreting the reliability of existing survey findings in this domain.</p>

      <!-- **Abstract**: The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants. -->

      <!-- **Abstract**: HSBC's solution analyses 12 problem statements in this Global CBDC Challenge and uses 15 dimensions (e.g. business secrecy, latency, scalability, accessibility, etc.) to measure a retail CBDC system. Their analysis and research found that consensus algorithms and related operating models are key components of CBDC design for central banks. With this in mind, HSBC built an evaluation platform to provide central banks with consensus algorithm recommendations and operating model options. -->

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>While the environmental impact has become an important IT governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether its disclosure 
      is valued by token holders of platforms based on blockchain IT infrastructure and how these platforms react to changing public awareness 
      of their environmental impacts. We consider Elon Musk's 2021 announcement that Tesla would suspend accepting Bitcoin as payment because 
      of Bitcoin mining's environmental impact as a shock that dramatically increases awareness of Bitcoin mining's environmental impacts. 
      We find that, subsequent to the shock, infrastructure platforms which have larger environmental impacts than application platforms, are 
      more likely to disclose environmental impact information than application platforms and that their token market values grow at a slower 
      rate, consistent with the increased awareness spills over to other token-based platforms. Furthermore, whereas pre-shock environmental 
      impact disclosure by infrastructure platforms reduces token market value growth rates, post-shock disclosure has the opposite effect, 
      consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing, respectively.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Traditional centralized models allow consumers to provide input, but are often limited by selection biases. Instead, blockchain-based decentralized models extend all consumer voice but face sustainability challenges including unsustained contributions and voting power concentration. Utilizing data from a blockchain-based K-pop platform, this study investigates whether fans continue contributing to the platform after initially participating in voting rounds. Findings indicate that voting power becomes less concentrated over time, likely because voters who have smaller voting power value the equity of decentralized voting and increase both tangible and intangible contributions. Conversely, voters who have larger voting power experience expectation disconfirmation; they begin with high expectations about influencing outcomes but if their preferences are disappointed, they decrease tangible contributions while maintaining intangible contributions. We use value cocreation and expectation disconfirmation theory to explain the phenomenon. This study contributes to blockchain and user innovation research and offers practical insights for platform designers aiming to create equitable, sustainable consumer-driven ecosystems.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Public blockchains with smart contract functionality have revolutionized IT operations by enabling fully algorithmic processes and providing high transparency through realtime and detailed information disclosure. Yet, the impact of this IT operational model on user engagement remains largely unexplored. Leveraging the context of stablecoin platforms, particularly in light of the Terra-LUNA crisis, we construct a large-scale individual-level panel dataset from April 12 to June 1, 2022, and apply a cross-platform difference-in-differences approach. We find that, during crises, users can effectively distinguish between algorithmic and institutional IT operations, as well as their respective types of operational transparency. We also find that the presence of attackers switches user preferences for operational transparency. Higher levels of transparency, characterized by frequent and detailed information disclosures, may be perceived as catalysts for attacks in the post-crisis period, significantly impacting user engagement.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>This study investigates the public's perception of retail central bank digital currency (rCBDC) and identifies the factors influencing its adoption. Conducted in collaboration with a prominent bank in Hong Kong, this research involved a hands-on experience with a prototype payment system making using of an e-HKD, being an rCBDC which could be implemented in Hong Kong. Participants' opinions on rCBDCs were assessed through surveys conducted before and after their engagement with the e-HKD pilot. Initially, participants displayed a broadly positive attitude towards rCBDC, although no single factor emerged as a decisive influence on their adoption decision. However, the pilot experience statistically significantly altered perceptions, particularly regarding security, ease of payment, and promotional functions, thereby impacting their willingness to adopt rCBDC. This study underscores the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and suggests that these perceptions are subject to change through exposure to regulatory information campaigns, prototype experiences, and initial models.Consequently, the study recommends a cautious approach to interpreting the reliability of existing survey findings in this domain.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants.</p>

      <p>HSBC's solution analyses 12 problem statements in this Global CBDC Challenge and uses 15 dimensions (e.g. business secrecy, latency, scalability, accessibility, etc.) to measure a retail CBDC system. Their analysis and research found that consensus algorithms and related operating models are key components of CBDC design for central banks. With this in mind, HSBC built an evaluation platform to provide central banks with consensus algorithm recommendations and operating model options.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>We propose a Central Bank Digital Currency Evaluation and Verification (CEV) Framework for recommending and verifying technical solutions in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) system. We demonstrate two sub-frameworks: an evaluation sub-framework that provides consensus algorithm and operating architecture solutions and a verification sub-framework that validates the proposed solutions. Our framework offers a universal CBDC solution that is compatible with different national economic and regulatory regimes. The evaluation sub-framework generates customized solutions by splitting the consensus algorithms into several components and analyzing their impacts on CBDC systems. CBDC design involves a trade-off between system features - the consensus algorithm cannot achieve all system features simultaneously. However, we also improve the operating architectures to compensate for the weak system features. The verification sub-framework helps verify our proposed solution through empirical experiments and formal proof. Our framework offers CBDC designers the flexibility to iteratively tune the trade-off between CBDC system features for the desired solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a framework to recommend and verify CBDC technical solutions.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Software code quality is a construct with three dimensions: maintainability, reliability, and functionality. Although many firms have incorporated code quality metrics in their operations, evaluating these metrics still lacks consistent standards. We categorized distinct metrics into two types: 1) monotonic metrics that consistently influence code quality; and 2) non-monotonic metrics that lack a consistent relationship with code quality. To consistently evaluate them, we proposed a distribution-based method to get metric scores. Our empirical analysis includes 36,460 high-quality open-source software (OSS) repositories and their raw metrics from SonarQube and CK. The evaluated scores demonstrate great explainability on software adoption. Our work contributes to the multi-dimensional construct of code quality and its metric measurements, which provides practical implications for consistent measurements on both monotonic and non-monotonic metrics.</p>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>Traditional banks face significant challenges in digital transformation, primarily due to legacy system constraints and fragmented ownership. Recent incidents show that such fragmentation often results in superficial incident resolutions, leaving root causes unaddressed and causing recurring failures. We introduce a novel approach to post-incident analysis, integrating knowledge-based GenAI agents with the "Five Whys" technique to examine problem descriptions and change request data. This method uncovered that approximately 70% of the incidents previously attributed to management or vendor failures were due to underlying internal code issues. We present a case study to show the impact of our method. By scanning over 5,000 projects, we identified over 400 files with a similar root cause. Overall, we leverage the knowledge-based agents to automate and elevate root cause analysis, transforming it into a more proactive process. These agents can be applied across other phases of the software development lifecycle, further improving development processes.</p>

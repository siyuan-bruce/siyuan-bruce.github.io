      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>While the environmental impact has become an important IT governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether its disclosure 
      is valued by token holders of platforms based on blockchain IT infrastructure and how these platforms react to changing public awareness 
      of their environmental impacts. We consider Elon Musk’s 2021 announcement that Tesla would suspend accepting Bitcoin as payment because 
      of Bitcoin mining's environmental impact as a shock that dramatically increases awareness of Bitcoin mining's environmental impacts. 
      We find that, subsequent to the shock, infrastructure platforms which have larger environmental impacts than application platforms, are 
      more likely to disclose environmental impact information than application platforms and that their token market values grow at a slower 
      rate, consistent with the increased awareness spills over to other token-based platforms. Furthermore, whereas pre-shock environmental 
      impact disclosure by infrastructure platforms reduces token market value growth rates, post-shock disclosure has the opposite effect, 
      consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing, respectively.</p>

  - Joint with HKUST School of Business and Management and HSBC Holdings plc (2023). “e-HKD Pilot Programme”. [[Summary]](https://www.about.hsbc.com.hk/-/media/hong-kong/en/news-and-media/hypothetical-e-hkd-phase-1-pilot-factsheet-en.pdf) [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority Report]](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20231030e3a1.pdf).
  
      <!-- **Abstract**: The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants. -->

  - Yong Xia, **Siyuan Jin**, Bing Qu, Yingli Liu, Linzhen Yang. Joint with HSBC Bank (Singapore) Limited and HSBC Holdings plc (2021).  “Global CBDC Challenge Report”. Awarded as [Global CBDC Challenge Finalist](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/mas-announces-15-finalists-for-the-global-cbdc-challenge?fbclid=IwAR0B9v-5FBSXcnr61edLVwEch-jJ5EV8-pSJwYe00erQdS8rGreTtZIYABY) (Top 5% in over 300+ submissions from 50+ countries) [[Monetary Authority of Singapore Report]](https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/cbdc/global-cbdc-challenge-report-2021.pdf)

      <!-- **Abstract**: HSBC's solution analyses 12 problem statements in this Global CBDC Challenge and uses 15 dimensions (e.g. business secrecy, latency, scalability, accessibility, etc.) to measure a retail CBDC system. Their analysis and research found that consensus algorithms and related operating models are key components of CBDC design for central banks. With this in mind, HSBC built an evaluation platform to provide central banks with consensus algorithm recommendations and operating model options. -->
